## 📦 Installation & Usage

### ⚙️ Hardware Setup
1. Connect each servo to ESP32 PWM pins (e.g., D13–D17).  
2. Power servos with an external 5V supply (common ground with ESP32).  
3. Assemble servos to hand frame and calibrate positions.  

### 💻 Software Setup
1. Flash ESP32 with Arduino sketch.  
2. Connect ESP32 to Wi-Fi or use Access Point mode.  
3. Open browser and navigate to ESP32 IP address.  
4. Control the hand through the dashboard!
